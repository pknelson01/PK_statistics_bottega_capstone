### Implemented Features NOT LEARNED in the course:
- **Image Scroller:** I looked up css documentation to find options such as *overflow* and *overscroll-behavior-inline* which were crucial in the creation of this feature.
- **Custom Scrollbar:** Used ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb to completely customize my scrollbar to fit the aesthetic of the site.
